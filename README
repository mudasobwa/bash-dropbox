The goal of a project is to provide a crypted secure dropbox-like transparent service for ‘cloud’ content storage

Architecture (As for Version 1, possibly being subject of change later)
A server, as simple as possible. Stores content, provides ssh access for clients.
Tiny Client, based on common *nix utilities:
* ssh + sshfs
* inotify + incron
* if-up / if-down functions
As of Version 1 we don't plan to support any OS with exception of Linux.

The server simply stores the client content. ‘Content’ here means e. g. files, database entities (such as tables 
or even records), emails, jabber messages… whatever the user wants to have stored. It is responsible for backups 
of the content. Nothing more at the moment.
